Question 1
c.1.What are benefits to use Scrum?
Ans: As scrum framework is agile, the following are its benefits:-
->The changes in the requirement from the customer can be accomodated at later point of time easily
->Their is regular feedback for improvement, as after every sprint there is a customer review given
->Fast delivery of the features of the product, need not have to wait for the final product to be delivered.
->There are daily updates in a scrum for tracking the task completion
->As a complex product is divided into subsets and worked on, it makes the task simplier,easier and accomplishable.
->We can prioritise the important features and work according to the priorities set in the product backlog. 
->When there are several customer reviews after every sprint at diiferent point of development, gives a sense of confidence that the product development is going in the right direction.

Question 2
c.2.According to Cynefin framework, what are five problem domains? Which problem domain(s) is Scrum particularly well suited for?
Ans: The five problem domains in Cynefin framework are
            Complex domain
            Simple domain
            Complicated domain
            Disorder domain
            Chaotic domain
     The complex problem domain is well suited for scrum as the requirements from the customer aren't fixed and may change in future i.e they are unpredictable. In such a case it is better to use the scrum methology.
